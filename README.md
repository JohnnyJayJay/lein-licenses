# lein-licenses

A [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) plugin related to dependency licenses. A fork of [tools-licenses](https://github.com/pmonks/tools-licenses), which in turn is inspired by the already existing (discontinued) [`lein-licenses`](https://github.com/technomancy/lein-licenses/) Leiningen plugin (we've come full circle). 
Similar to tools-licenses, this new plugin has the added benefit of license canonicalisation (leveraging the *excellent* [Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.dev/) standard) and the ability to check your project against the [Apache Software Foundation's 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

## Tasks

1. `licenses` - attempt to display the licenses used by all transitive dependencies of the project
2. `check-asf-policy` - attempt to check your project's compliance with the ASF's 3rd Party License Policy

## Using the library

### Documentation

[FAQ is available here](https://github.com/pmonks/tools-licenses/wiki/FAQ).

### Dependency

Add the following to your `project.clj` `:plugins` list:

```edn
[com.github.johnnyjayjay/lein-licenses "0.1.0"]
```

### Use the build tasks

#### `licenses` task

Example summary output:

```
$ lein licenses
This project: Apache-2.0

License                                  Number of Deps
---------------------------------------- --------------

BSD-3-Clause                             1
CDDL-1.0                                 1

```

Use `lein licenses :detailed` to get detailed, per-dependency output (too long to reasonably include here).

If you see `NON-SPDX-Unknown` license identifiers, and/or the task displays a list of dependencies with unknown licenses, **[please raise an issue here](https://github.com/pmonks/lice-comb/issues/new?assignees=pmonks&labels=unknown+licenses&template=Unknown_licenses_tools.md)**.

#### `check-asf-policy` task

Example summary output:

```
$ lein check-asf-policy
Category                       Number of Deps
------------------------------ --------------
Category A                     79

Use `lein check-asf-policy :detailed` to get detailed, per-dependency output (too long to reasonably include here).

### Developer Workflow

This project uses the [git-flow branching strategy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), with the caveat that the permanent branches are called `main` and `dev`, and any changes to the `main` branch are considered a release and auto-deployed (JARs to Clojars, API docs to GitHub Pages, etc.).

For this reason, **all development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in temporary branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs from forked repos must also be submitted against `dev`; the `main` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `main` will be rejected.
